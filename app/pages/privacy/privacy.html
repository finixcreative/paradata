Accordingly, we do not assume any liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, such as transmissions involving the exchange of e-mail with us (including those which may contain your personal information).
			</p>
			<p>
				Paradata takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect your information.
