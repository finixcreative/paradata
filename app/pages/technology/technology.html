						<h4>DATA HARMONY</h4>
						<p>The first thing that Paradata solutions do is harmonize different data sets and build trustworthy datasets about vendors, materials, competitors, pricing, market trends, and more. This is not a basic data cleansing. Data cleansing is removing or correcting data simply to improve customer service. Paradata creates data harmony to extract more business insights that drive operating profits.</p>

						<h4>​DATA PROVENANCE</h4>
						<p>Data provenance signifies the origins of a piece of data and the process by which it arrived in a database. Having the peace of mind of knowing where something came from is essential to accuracy and quality. You’d be more likely to buy a famous painting if you knew the chain of custody. This is a record of its owners since inception. You would also want to know the chain of custody of your data. Paradata delivers this data provenance and peace of mind.</p>

						<h4>​DARK DATA</h4>
						<p>Paradata offers a solution on the front end which helps companies find operating profit in dark data. This is data that has no real tactical value at all. Gartner defines dark data as “the information assets organizations collect, process and store during regular business activities, but generally fail to use for other purposes. Dark data often comprises most organizations’ universe of information assets".</p>
