				<h3 class="center">Working at Paradata</h3>
				<p>Are you interested in joining our dynamic and diverse team? Please call us or email your resume to <a href="mailto:hr@paradata.io">hr@paradata.io</a></p>
				<p>We are located in the heart of the Silicon Valley close to SAP Center or what locals refer to as the “Shark Tank.” Our office is near a variety of restaurants and coffee shops. We’re in Little Italy near VTA Light Rail and highway 87 ramp. Although we could use a little more rain these days, our weather is fantastic throughout the year with very little humidity in the summer.</p>
				<p>San Jose is so awesome you can go snow skiing and surfing in the same weekend. We’re 60 miles south of San Francisco and just a few short miles to where the San Francisco 49rs football team and San Jose Earthquakes soccer team play, and a 3-hour drive to Yosemite National Park.</p>

				<h4>Working at Paradata you'll be involved with:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p><b>State of the art tech stack to work on</b> - our tech stack is so shiny and new it’s almost embarrassing to throw out all these buzz words but we can’t hide from the truth. If working with MongoDB, Node.js, Python, React.js is interesting to you, come join the team.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Huge problem in the enterprise we’re solving</b> - every single company that manufactures a product needs our software because the industry is leaking hundreds of billions of dollars every year and Paradata can stop the leaks.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Open, collaborative culture</b> - open floor plan, open culture of respect and accountability. We win together and lose together as a team.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Start up in fast forward</b> - we just raised our Series A round in April 2015 and we’re about to launch our first product offering this summer - somehow we already have customers paying us seven figures before we’ve released our first version.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<h4>We offer a wide range of benefits:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p><b>Health Programs</b> - we offer generous medical, dental, and vision plans where employees only pay 10% of the premium and we split the cost of covering your dependents.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>401(k) Program</b> - our plan features a great online platform to educate, plan, and invest your retirement assets so you can meet your goals after Paradata.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Bonuses</b> - every employee has the opportunity to earn frequent bonuses based on their individual contributions and Paradata’s success.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Training and Development</b> - we promote a culture of continuous learning and offer various professional development training courses and reimbursement, including jumping straight into the deep end of the pool.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Catered Lunches</b> - we’ve partnered with local restaurants to bring in custom gourmet meals featuring locally sourced, sustainable ingredients. How’s this for a power lunch - farm raised salmon a la plancha, forbidden black rice, asparagus, lemon hollandaise sauce or home made Soba noodles, stirfried with seasonal, organic summer vegetables, grilled free range chicken breast in 1000 year spice sauce.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Chill-Out Areas</b> - our lounge, pool table, dart boards, and kitchen islands are popular hangouts to recharge or collaborate.</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Time Away</b> - employees work at peak performance when they’re happy, and a big part of being happy at work is being happy outside of work. We want you to take time off, and take advantage of our generous vacation program, and do the things that keep you fresh and motivated.</p></li>
